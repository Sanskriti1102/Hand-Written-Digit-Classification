#  Hand-Written-Digit-Classification

### Problem statement:
Create a Deep learning model to predict the different hand written digits ranging from 0 to 9
## Context: 
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto
“hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of
handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new
machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and
learners alike.
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each
pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that
pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.
The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels
(see above), and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

## Details of datasets:
Each target variable for training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:
<br>
0<br>
1<br>
2<br>
3<br>
4<br>
5<br>
6<br>
7<br>
8<br>
9<br>
These labels denote the hand written digits which can be plotted as we
